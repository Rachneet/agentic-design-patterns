Our modern approach to hybrid, multicloud infrastructure and data management, which we term ‘evolved cloud’, provides customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability which increases our relevance and value to our customers.\\n\\n\\nIn an evolved cloud state, the cloud is fully integrated into an organization’s architecture and operations. Data centers and clouds are seamlessly united and hybrid multicloud operations are simplified, with consistency and observability across environments. The key benefits NetApp brings to an organization’s hybrid multicloud environment are:\\n\\n\\n•\\nOperational simplicity: NetApp’s use of open source, open architectures and APIs, microservices, and common capabilities and data services facilitate the creation of applications that can run anywhere.\\n\\n\\n•\\nFlexibility and consistency: NetApp makes moving data and applications between environments seamless through a common storage foundation across on-premises and multicloud environments.',\n",

We were incorporated in 1992 and are headquartered in San Jose, California. Building on more than three decades of innovation, we give customers the freedom to manage applications and data across hybrid multicloud environments. Our portfolio of cloud services, and storage infrastructure, powered by intelligent data management software, enables applications to run faster, more reliably, and more securely, all at a lower cost.\\n\\n\\nOur opportunity is defined by the durable megatrends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. NetApp helps organizations meet the complexities created by rapid data and cloud growth, multi-cloud management, and the adoption of next-generation technologies, such as AI, Kubernetes, and modern databases. Our modern approach to hybrid, multicloud infrastructure and data management, which we term ‘evolved cloud’, provides customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability which increases our relevance and value to our customers.\\n\\n\\nIn an evolved cloud state, the cloud is fully integrated into an organization’s architecture and operations. Data centers and clouds are seamlessly united and hybrid multicloud operations are simplified, with consistency and observability across environments. The key benefits NetApp brings to an organization’s hybrid multicloud environment are:\\n\\n\\n•\\nOperational simplicity: NetApp’s use of open source, open architectures and APIs, microservices, and common capabilities and data services facilitate the creation of applications that can run anywhere.\\n\\n\\n•\\nFlexibility and consistency: NetApp makes moving data and applications between environments seamless through a common storage foundation across on-premises and multicloud environments.'}"
