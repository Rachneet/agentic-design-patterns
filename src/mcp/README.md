### Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol uses a client-server model to standardize information flow. Understanding component interaction is key to MCP's advanced agentic behavior:


1. **Large Language Model (LLM)**: The core intelligence. It processes user requests, formulates plans, and decides when it needs to access external information or perform an action.

2. **MCP Client**: This is an application or wrapper around the LLM. It acts as the intermediary, translating the LLM's intent into a formal request that conforms to the MCP standard. It is responsible for discovering, connecting to, and communicating with MCP Servers.

3. **MCP Server**: This is the gateway to the external world. It exposes a set of tools, resources, and prompts to any authorized MCP Client. Each server is typically responsible for a specific domain, such as a connection to a company's internal database, an email service, or a public API.

4. **â€‹Optional Third-Party (3P) Service**: This represents the actual external tool, application, or data source that the MCP Server manages and exposes. It is the ultimate endpoint that performs the requested action, such as querying a proprietary database, interacting with a SaaS platform, or calling a public weather API.
